ABOUT :

This picture shows the **home page of a personal portfolio website**, designed for a web developer or creative professional. The overall look of the website is clean, modern, and visually appealing, which is very important for creating a strong first impression. It feels professional but also friendly, making visitors comfortable as soon as they land on the page.

At the top of the page, there is a **navigation bar**. On the left side, the name “person name” is displayed, which works as a personal brand or identity. On the right side, there are menu options such as *Home, About, Skills,* and *Contact Us*. These options help users easily navigate through different sections of the portfolio. The design is responsive, as shown by the hamburger menu icon, which allows the navigation to work smoothly on smaller screens like mobile devices.

The main section of the page is divided into two parts. On the **left side**, there is a circular profile image. The circular shape gives a modern and stylish feel, which is commonly used in portfolio websites today. The image helps create a personal connection with the visitor, making the portfolio feel more human and relatable instead of just technical.

On the **right side**, the main content is displayed. The heading starts with a friendly greeting, *“Hey I’m person”*, which instantly makes the page feel welcoming. Below that, the text *“I’m a Web Developer”* clearly explains the person’s profession. This clarity is very useful for recruiters or clients who want to quickly understand what the person does.

Below the heading, there is a short paragraph of text (currently placeholder text). In a real portfolio, this section would usually describe the person’s background, skills, experience, and passion for web development. This is where the developer can tell their story and explain what makes them unique.

Under the description, **social media icons** for GitHub and LinkedIn are shown. These icons are important because they allow visitors to check the developer’s professional profiles, projects, and work experience. It also shows that the person is active in the professional and developer community.

At the bottom of the content section, there is a **“Download CV” button**. This button is very useful for recruiters, as it allows them to quickly download the resume without searching through the website. The button stands out visually, encouraging users to take action.

The page also uses **smooth animations**, such as fade, zoom, and slide effects. These animations make the website more interactive and engaging without being distracting. Overall, this picture represents a well-designed, user-friendly, and professional portfolio homepage that effectively showcases a web developer’s identity, skills, and personality in a human and approachable way.
